# I need a MEME â€” Hackathon

"I need a MEME" is a situational meme generation and lookup
application that combines the power of text AI and image generation to
create personalized memes. Users can describe situations or desired
memes, and the system intelligently matches them with appropriate
templates from the Memegen.link API, then generates custom content
using Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview.
